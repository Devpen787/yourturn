# ETHOnline 2026 Progress Log

This is the handoff surface for hourly/overnight continuation. Keep entries terse, factual and evidence-backed.

## Current state

- Baseline frozen: `d0b5f875afb4f2b29af29bc5972cf1edc404d473`
- Foundation branch: `feature/ethonline-2026-foundation`
- Current phase: Foundation / task harness
- Primary sponsor targets: Hedera Continuity, World AgentKit Continuity, Ledger Continuity
- Product target: YourTurn Delegated Recovery

## Priority order

1. Finish foundation task surface and CI/harness.
2. Hedera spike: serial-scoped NFT allowance + revoke + transfer-with-allowance on testnet.
3. Hedera spike: non-custodial grant path (`RETURN_BYTES` or equivalent proven path).
4. Hedera spike: USDC customer settlement, with atomic USDC+NFT transfer as preferred target.
5. Domain policy + idempotency/replay guard.
6. Hero UX journey.
7. World AgentKit integration.
8. Ledger supported-path spike; kill/replace with Bazantic if blocked.
9. Independent sponsor/security reviews.
10. Integration, demo and submission proof.

## Handoff template

## Foundation entries

### 2026-09-09 — foundation created
- Branch/SHA: `feature/ethonline-2026-foundation` from baseline `d0b5f875...`
- Mission: freeze continuity truth and define execution system.
- Changed: continuity baseline, master plan, build loop and machine-readable acceptance contract.
- Verification actually run: repository history/implementation inspected; no code build is claimed by this documentation-only step.
- Evidence: see `docs/ethonline-2026/`.
- Failed/open: sponsor branches and executable CI/harness still to be created.
- Claim impact: none yet; process only.
- Exact next action: create sponsor task files + CI/harness, then begin Hedera allowance testnet spike.
